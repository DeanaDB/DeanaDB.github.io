        <h1><strong>Welcome to Middle School Science.  Where curiosity leads to discovery!</strong></h1>
        <p>In our classroom, science is more than just facts and formulas. It’s about asking questions, exploring ideas, and discovering how the world works. Throughout the year, we’ll dive into exciting topics like scientific methods, ecosystems, cells, and weather and climate. We will investigate through hands-on labs, projects, and discussions that encourage curiosity and critical thinking. My goal is to create an environment where you feel confident exploring, safe in making mistakes, and growing.  Together, we’ll learn to see science not only as a subject, but as an adventure that connects us to our everyday lives.</p>
