        <h1>Welcome to Middle School Science.  Where curiosity leads to discovery!</h1>
                        
        <p>In our classroom, science is <em>more than just facts and formulas</em>. It’s about asking questions, exploring ideas, and discovering how the world works. 
             
            Throughout the year, we’ll dive into exciting topics like <strong>scientific methods</strong>, <strong>ecosystems</strong>, <strong> cells</strong>, and <strong>weather and climate</strong>. We will investigate through hands-on labs, projects, and discussions that encourage curiosity and critical thinking. My goal is to create an environment where you feel confident exploring, <em>safe in making mistakes</em>, and growing.  Together, we’ll learn to see science not only as a subject, but as an adventure that connects us to our everyday lives.
        </p>
