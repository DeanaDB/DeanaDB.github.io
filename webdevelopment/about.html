    <h1>Meet Mrs. Bartholomew</h1>
        
    <p>Hi, I’m Mrs. Bartholomew!
        <br>
        I have been a <strong>middle school science teacher</strong> for 16 years.  I love helping students ask big questions and discover how the world works. Learning and teaching are two of my favorite things.  I believe it’s important to <em>stay curious</em> and appreciate the little things in life.  Over the years, teaching middle school students has brought so many fun and meaningful experiences in the classroom.  I am so excited to learn and grow with you this year!
        <br>
        I am married to my best friend.  We have two awesome sons who keep life exciting and full of laughter.  When I am not teaching, I love being outdoors enjoying nature, spending quality time with my family, or reading a good book. 
    </p>
